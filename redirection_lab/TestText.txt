Hello hello this is testing text
Stars are pretty but they can explode in glittery
Displays of glittery-ness called a supernova
Unrelatedly, pasta is the best food in the world
But ramen is also good
Oh and also the best pasta shape is penne though fusilli is a close second
Ziti doesn't have the ridges so its not as cool as penne
